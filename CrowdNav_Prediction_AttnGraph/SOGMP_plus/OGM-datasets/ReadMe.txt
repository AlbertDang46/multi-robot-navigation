Description: three occupancy grid map datasets for the paper titled "Stochastic Occupancy Grid Map Prediction in Dynamic Scenes" by Zhanteng Xie and Philip Dames

1. OGM-Turtlebot2: collected by a simulated Turtlebot2 with a maximum speed of 0.8 m/s navigates around a lobby Gazebo environment with 34 moving pedestrians using random start points and goal points

2. OGM-Jackal: extracted from two sub-datasets of the socially compliant navigation dataset (SCAND), which was collected by the Jackal robot with a maximum speed of 2.0 m/s at the outdoor environment of the UT Austin

3. OGM-Spot: extracted from two sub-datasets of the socially compliant navigation dataset (SCAND), which was collected by the Spot robot with a maximum speed of 1.6 m/s at the Union Building of the UT Austin
